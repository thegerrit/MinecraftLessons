### How to Subtract in Binary
Binary subtraction is very similar to binary addition. Where we use the AND gate in addition, we use the XOR gate in subtraction.  <br>
`0 XOR 0 = 0`<br>
`1 XOR 0 = 1` <br>
`1 XOR 1 = 0` <br>

![binary subtraction](#)<br>
When we try to compute `0 - 1` in one digit place, we must borrow from the digit place to the left of it. We replace the one to the left with a zero. Then, in the current digit place, we compute `10 - 1 = 1`. This is the same procedure that you do when you compute `10 - 9` in decimal.

Note: it is important to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. If we do this the other way around, we will compute a negative number without the negative sign. This would be __erroneous__.<br>
`0 XOR 1 = 1`<br>
However, `0 - 1 = -1` not `1`.

### Practice
Compute the 6-bit binary subtractions detailed below. Converting to decimal is not necessary.
1. 100011 - 011011
2. 101010 - 010101
3. 001000 - 000001
4. 100000 - 000001
5. 100100 - 011111

### Binary Subtraction Circuits.
Just like binary addition, binary subtraction circuits come in two types: __Half Subtractor Circuits__ and __Full Subtractor Circuits__ (composed of half subtractor circuits). We will only concern ourselves with Half Circuits. The implementation of a Full Subtractor Circuit will be a challenge activity.

#### Half Subtractor Circuit Diagram
![half subtractor circuit](#)<br>
The upper path can be thought of as `a XOR b`. It computes the subtraction of the two bits in their place. The lower path is `(NOT a) AND b`. This computes the __borrow bit__. The borrow bit indicates that we must borrow a `1` from the next digit to the left. This way when we compute `0 - 1` our borrow bit is `1`, representing that we must take a `1` from the next digit to the left.

### Activity 1
Now that you know how to subtract in binary, create a Half Subtractor Circuit within Minecraft that subtracts two 1-bit binary numbers. _Hint: What logical gate do we use for subtraction?_

### Activity 2
Use what you know about carry bits to construct a circuit that computes the subtraction between two 2-bit binary numbers.

### Activity 3 (Challenge Activity)
String together Half Subtractor Circuits to create a Full Subtractor Circuit. You will need to research how to implement a Full Subtractor Circuit.
