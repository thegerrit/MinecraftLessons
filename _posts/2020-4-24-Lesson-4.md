### How to Subtract in Binary
Binary subtraction is very similar to binary addition. Where we use the AND gate in addition, we use the XOR gate in subtraction.  <br>
`0 XOR 0 = 0`<br>
`1 XOR 0 = 1` <br>
`1 XOR 1 = 0` <br>
Note: it is important to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. If we do this the other way around, we will compute a negative number without the negative sign. This would be erroneous.<br>
`0 XOR 1 = 1`<br>
However, `0 - 1 = -1` not `1`.

### Practice
Compute the 6-bit binary subtractions detailed below. Converting to decimal is not necessary.
1. 100011 - 011011
2. 101010 - 010101
3. 001000 - 000001
4. 100000 - 000001
5. 100100 - 011111

### Activity 1
Now that you know how to subtract in binary, create a circuit within Minecraft that subtracts two 1-bit binary numbers. _Hint: What logical gate do we use for subtraction?_

### Activity 2
Use what you know about carry bits to construct a circuit that computes the subtraction between two 2-bit binary numbers.

### Activity 3 (Challenge Activity)
Can you make a subtractor circuit that is capable of returning negative numbers? In other words, if you input `1-2` into your circuit, does it return -1?

### Activity 4 (Challenge Activity)
What is the largest number of bits that you can make a subtraction circuit with.
