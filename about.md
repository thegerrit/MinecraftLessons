[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) is more than just a beautiful video-game. It can be used as an educational tool as well. This site contains step-by-step lesson plans for teaching high-school students a wide range of Computer Science topics using Minecraft. This allows students to apply and experiment with concepts in an open-ended, hands-on environment. The topics currently covered are listed below.

### Currently Included Topics

1. Binary Numbers
2. Logic Gates
3. Mathematical operations on binary numbers (addition, subtraction)

### Topics that could be added in the future
1. More mathematical binary operations (division, subtraction, modulo)
2. Information storage (SR latches, flip flops)
